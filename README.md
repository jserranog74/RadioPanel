# RadioPanel

Hardware / Software Radio Panel for Flight Simulation
The objective of this project is to save the progress for the construction of a radio module for FS2020 and for whoever is interested. The idea is to build the panel with several frequency channels, a selector such as NAV1, NAV2, COM1, COM2, ..., and XPDR.
