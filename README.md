# RadioPanel

Hardware / Software Radio Panel for Flight Simulation
This project was created to save my progress about the construction of a radio module for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 and anyone interested is welcome. 
The radio module should have one/two pair of frequency channels, the swap button and a selector such as NAV1, NAV2, COM1, COM2, ..., and XPDR.

Similar to Saitek Radio Panel:
